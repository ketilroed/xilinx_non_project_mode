INFO: [Coretcl 2-1500] The part has been set to 'xc7z020clg400-1' for the current project only. Run set_part -help for more details. To evaluate different speed grades in the current design, use the set_speed_grade command, or use the open_checkpoint -part command to change the part used by an existing checkpoint design.

Finished Parsing XDC File [M:/workspace/zynq7020_basic_examples/non_project_mode/constraints/pynq_z2.xdc]
INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [M:/workspace/zynq7020_basic_examples/non_project_mode/constraints/pynq_z2.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/blinking_led_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/blinking_led_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
